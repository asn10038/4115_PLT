bubble.ll and bubble_with_optimization.ll vary in following aspects:

1. Length
bubble.ll has only 184 lines, while bubble_with_optimization.ll have 474 lines.

2. Call sites:
In bubble.ll, swap, printArray, and bubbleSort functions are called exactly designed by bubble.c.
In bubble_with_optimization.ll, the above functions are defined, but none of them are called anywhere.

3. Number of instructions of functions:
Let's first look at swap, because it only contains basic operations and does not call other functions.
bubble.ll has 16 instructions, while bubble_with_optimization.ll has only 5. 
It shows the optimizer (opt) succeeded to refactor the code.

Now let's look at bubbleSort, printArray, and main.
These functions have much more instructions in bubble_with_optimization.ll than in bubble.ll. Also, it is noticed that they do not call any functions, except memcpy and printf.
If we inspect carefully about the logics, we can see the optimizer integrates the called functions' codes into the calling functions. This is the reason why they contain more instructions than non-optimzed ones.
